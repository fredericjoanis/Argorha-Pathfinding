To hit 1.0
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- Systems (Ladders, elevators)
- Race, cars, jumping
- Enhance A* and organic path.  See SmithIdeas.txt
- Licensing 
- AABB and Vector3 are Ogre classes, so I can't do a dual license for now
- Moving zones and intersecting zones.
- Test floodfill point ( Or delete )
- Ogre demo
- Linux makefile and make it work on Mac
- Update DOxygen doc and put it on the SVN

Demos improvements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- Save and load.
- Extended feature for path (left mouse sets new, right adds an point to the existing one) 
- Optimisation
- Maybe do 2 demos for each engine, one optimize and complete, and one for the basics.

To try
¯¯¯¯¯¯
- GPU Pathfinding (OpenCL?)

Nice to have

-Make GOOF working back
